Frontend: After further research, using React Native enables cross-platform compatibility across
IOS and Android as well as allows a web app built with React.js to cater to Desktop usability.
Backend: A Node.js server using Express.js framework to handle API requests, process data, etc
Database: Databases such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage such as user profiles
and noise recording metadata. Can pair with PostGIS for better geographical data handling
Collection/Visualization: Smartphones’ built-in mics for collecting noise data, then geolocated
using GPS. Integration with Google Maps API to render the noise data on a geographic map
